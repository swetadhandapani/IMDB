The **IMDB Application** project is a full-stack web application
developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
Node.js). It aims to create a simplified version of an IMDB-like system
where users can perform CRUD operations on movie data. The project
focuses on backend API development with Express and MongoDB and a
frontend React application to consume these APIs.

**Project Overview**

This project is divided into two main parts:

1.  **IMDB Restful API** (Backend)

    -   Built using **Express.js** and **MongoDB** to handle the
        server-side operations and database management.

    -   Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for
        movie data.

2.  **React Application** (Frontend)

    -   Developed using **React.js** to interact with the backend API
        and provide a dynamic user interface for managing movie data.

**Backend: IMDB Restful API**

The backend API is responsible for managing the movie data stored in a
MongoDB database.

**Key Features and Topics Covered**

1.  **Nodemon for Development**:

    -   Automatically restarts the server when code changes are
        detected.

2.  **Environment Variables with .env**:

    -   Securely stores sensitive properties like database connection
        strings.

3.  **MongoDB Setup**:

    -   Created a MongoDB account and connected the application to a
        MongoDB database.

    -   Defined a schema using **Mongoose** to structure movie data.

4.  **CRUD Operations**:

    -   **POST**: Adds movie details to the database.

    -   **GET**: Retrieves the list of movies from the database.

    -   **PUT**: Updates specific movie details using its unique ID.

    -   **DELETE**: Removes a movie from the database using its unique
        ID.

**Frontend: React Application**

The React frontend provides an interface for users to interact with the
backend API.

**Key Features and Topics Covered**

1.  **API Integration with Axios**:

    -   Used the Axios library for seamless communication with the
        backend API.

    -   Handled all CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

2.  **Reusable Components**:

    -   Created reusable React components for adding and updating movie
        data, promoting code reusability and modularity.

3.  **Bootstrap for Styling**:

    -   Integrated **React-Bootstrap** for a responsive and visually
        appealing UI.

**Libraries Used**

1.  **Backend**:

    -   **Express**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.

    -   **Nodemon**: For automatic server restarts during development.

    -   **Mongoose**: For defining and interacting with the MongoDB
        schema.

    -   **dotenv**: To manage environment variables securely.

    -   **cors**: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing issues.

2.  **Frontend**:

    -   **Axios**: For API requests.

    -   **React-Bootstrap**: For responsive UI components.

**Tools Used**

1.  **MongoDB Compass**: For visualizing and managing the MongoDB
    database.

2.  **Visual Studio Code**: The primary code editor for development.

3.  **Postman**: For testing backend APIs.

**Project Workflow**

1.  **Backend Development**:

    -   Set up an Express server.

    -   Define routes for CRUD operations.

    -   Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

    -   Test APIs using Postman.

2.  **Frontend Development**:

    -   Create a React application with a structured component
        hierarchy.

    -   Use Axios to connect to the backend API.

    -   Build reusable components for adding and updating movies.

    -   Display movie data in a list format and provide actions for edit
        and delete.

**Conclusion**

This project is an excellent example of a full-stack application
leveraging the MERN stack. It showcases essential concepts such as:

-   Building and testing RESTful APIs.

-   Structuring and interacting with MongoDB databases.

-   Creating a responsive and dynamic React frontend.

-   Using popular libraries like Axios and Bootstrap to enhance
    functionality and design.

This IMDB Application is a foundational project that can be extended
with advanced features like user authentication, ratings, reviews, and
deployment to cloud platforms for a production-ready application.
